# mc-datapacks

My own custom datapacks for single/multiplayer

# coronapack
I've made this datapack during pandemic for server that me and my friends were playing on.
Features:
  1. No need for everyone to sleep at the same time to skip night, only one person is needed
  2. You can name armor stand "rece" and it will have arms
  3. Some new recipes for stonecutter
  
 # whitepack
 Basicly better version of coronapack with more features
 Features:
  1. same as coronapack
  2. Special achivements (only in polish, I'm lazy and haven't translated it (I didn't had to, beacuse it was only private))
  3. If you hold bow it shows you amount or arrows in inventory above hotbar
  4. I don't remember if it's everything :)
